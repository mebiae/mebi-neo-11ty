- Site's code has gone through a slight rewrite.
    - Mostly backend stuff, such as the changelog now condensed into a single JSON file.
    - It honestly looks a bit terrible; the parsing code.
- Sites in the Sites page will have a red border around it if the site no longer exists.
- Webcomics link added to mobile nav.
- The map of Aethepor is finally interactable with the use of SVG. Individual pages do not exist, yet. 
    - Formerly used &lt;map&gt;, but that does not respond to screen sizes without the use of JS.
