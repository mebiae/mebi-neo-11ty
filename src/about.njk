    <h1>About the Webmaster</h1>
    <section>
        <p>Heya! It's me, Mebi Aether! (or Mebiae, Mebi). I'm just a teen who lives in Canada and barely interacts with others on the net. I LOVE programming, drawing and making characters! I also occasionally play games by my own. (And maybe make a game one day)? I should mention that my interests often change time to time.</p>

        <p>I'm not much of a big interent guy; not wanting to interact with others and likes being alone most of the time. I do try to interact with others if I want to.</p>

        <p>My interest in programming began around 2021, starting off with Lua because I wanted to make a game on Roblox. My interest in programming later dropped a bit when I left Roblox, but regained that interest when I discovered Neocities. Neocities is the reason why I gained interest in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>The Webmaster's Childhood</h2>
    <section>
        <p>The internet access I had back then was a bit limited, and I'm not sure if I should be proud of that or not. I still remember playing on my IPad and using my home PC which ran Windows 7. (Still a great OS to me).</p>

        <p>Things pretty much remained the same, until 2020. With the lockdown in place, that limited access was loosened so I don't die of boredom. Even with unrestricted access, I still haven't ventured to places I shouldn't be in.</p>

    <h2>How did the name "Mebiae" came to be?</h2>
    <section>
        <p>Of course, Mebiae is not my actual name.</p>

        <p>I used to go by the name of A_FellowUnknown back then as that is the only name I could think of. Later, I wasn't satisfied with the name, and eventually came up with the name Mebi, which comes from the digital storage unit mebibyte (or bit).</p>

        <p>Why that name tho? Well, I wanted to have a name that is related to technology in some way, so I chose that name.</p>

        <p>It wasn't originally Mebiae; there would've been an underscore in the name (mebi_ae). I got the idea of the name Mebiae while I was playing a car physics game called BeamNG.drive.</p>

        <p>BeamNG allows you to set the license plate of your current car to your username. The license plate did not accept underscores, resulting the license place to say "mebiae".</p>

    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <section>
        <p><em>Mebi County</em> is just a small place on the net that I, Mebiae, created just for fun and to learn something new. This site is multipurpose, hosting whatever I want the internet to see here. (Like my OCs).</p>
