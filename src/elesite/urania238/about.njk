                        <p>My name is Urania Acti, I was born into existence (or discovered I should say), in 1789. I was discovered in Germany by a chemist by the name of Martin Klaproth. The metal me would not be discovered until 1841 in France by Eugene Peligot. Well, this would make me of European German-French origin. I am like every other atom out there; red and green eyes and hair, green electrons around my head, I am a female, uranium oxide on my hair, and a luxe-like sweater. (I try to look good). Anyways, this origin story is weird and stupid; that is not definitely what you maybe have come for. Let’s hope that I will catch your interest, will I? Will I not? Nevermind. I am very strong; do not judge my body size and type. Sure, I really do have an average body type, but I can physically handle pressure without breaking. Oh yeah, I am very flexible as well, including my clothing. Squish and stretch; I will still be the same. One more thing, better wish luck that I am still uranium when we meet; cause I may decay into another element, like thorium. (Do not wait)! How do  I act? How do I behave? (Oh please, oh no, sometimes I dislike describing my personality). Well, I do act tough most of the time, sometimes soft and squishy (I hope you know what I am talking about), and a slightly dull personality. I may sometimes go hard on other atoms sometimes, but I do not really mean it! I try to be nice with my crystal-like look. I am pretty radical and sometimes insane doing stuff; but most of the time I am chill. Oh wait, I am supposed to write a dating profile. Anyways, I am looking for another element who I have the most reactivity with. (Looking at you, non-metals). I will be honest, I slightly dislike non-metals due to me having a highly exothermic reaction upon contact and burning me and the other. But I realized that some of these non-metals are associated with nuclear power, which I absolutely adore. I know that there are few metal elements out there that can react with me. So yeah, I am looking for any element out there that will at least react with me. I barely care what temperature you are; just do not be above 1000°C. Wait, interests! Interests! I almost forgot about that! I am a big fan of nuclear power; those big electricity generation facilities! (Although it is actually steam power). Nuclear power is nearly 100% clean, and I wish for it to be the top one day. I basically love stuff related to nuclear/radioactivity. I do not like nuclear weapons though, but I do like being used as an armor plate; that is so cool! I used to be the norm back in the days, I was formerly used in stuff like in glass, photos, painting, and possibly much more. I know that a close friend of mine, Radi, was used to making watch dials glow. Anyways, anyways! I am going off track again! To sum things up, I like nuclear and radioactivity stuff. I will try to act my best behavior the first time we meet! I wish to see you soon, future-element-that-is-a-good-pair-to-uranium. Cya!
